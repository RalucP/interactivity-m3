This demo uses an envelope to ease to a value.

A 'target value' is set by the vertical position of clicking within the rectangle. This also triggers the envelope and starts sampling it.

The value from the envelope is multiplied by the target, so that the value we're using to visualise slowly reaches the target and then decays back to zero.
